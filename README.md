## About
An informative website with clear and interactive charts presenting the current COVID-19 situation in Canada. In addition to simple statistics on cases, mortality, testing and vaccines, the website also shows what "flattening the curve" looks like for Canada and on how our social distancing efforts and lockdown seem to be working. Also available are doubling times for cases for provinces in Canada.

The motivation to develop this website was to improve upon already available dashboards with a better design, interactive charts and mobile friendly layouts.
